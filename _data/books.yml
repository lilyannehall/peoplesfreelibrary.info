- title: Activist Trauma & Recovery 
  summary: >
    One of the amazing things about activists is that we often
    deliberately expose ourselves to brutality when we believe it
    necessary. What is sometimes equally surprising is how little
    we know about the psychological effects of this violence. We
    need to prepare ourselves and learn how to support each other
    through the physical and emotional consequences of trauma.

- title: Do-It-Yourself Occupation Guide 2024 Edition 
  summary: >
    This “2024 Edition” of the Do-It-Yourself Occupation Guide updates
    only a few pieces of outdated or incorrect information in the practical
    sections, along with some minor additions and reformatting. The writ-
    ing and analysis is otherwise identical to the 2012 edition. This edit was
    an independent effort not connected to the original authors; it comes in
    light of a nationwide resurgence of student occupations in 2024, begin-
    ning with Columbia University in New York, in response to an ongoing
    genocide in Palestine. This edition is released in hopes that the practical
    instructions and insights of the 2009-2012 occupation movements will
    prove useful to a new generation of students
